## Overview

This site is a web app designed for helping consumers find short-term rentals of
homes. Modeled after a certain other home-sharing app (...cough),
This app allows users to search for homes via location and filter based on price,
occupancy, and proposed dates of stay. Users can then request a reservation, view their upcoming and past trips,
and leave reviews of homes they've visited.

## Technologies

Implement a Rails backend with a JavaScript frontend. ActiveRecord and
Postgresql are employed for data storage and querying. HTML and CSS are responsible
for all styling and animations (emphasis on CSS keyframes for movement). Finally, React with Redux
is used for systematic uniformity of back/frontend interactions and rendering.

Note: jQuery is used in one instance (price filter) for demonstration of skill. Emphasizes
interaction with the virtual DOM in all other cases.
